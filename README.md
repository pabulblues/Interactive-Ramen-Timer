# 🍜 Ramen Timer – Interactive Web Animation

This is a fun, interactive timer built as part of my personal learning journey into web development. The timer is designed specifically for boiling ramen — set to **3 minutes and 20 seconds** — with a reminder at the **2-minute mark** to stir the noodles. When the time is up, a cheerful message lets you know: **“It’s ramen time!”**

The project combines:

- **HTML** for layout  
- **CSS** for styling and animations (e.g., button jiggle, hover effects, steam animation)  
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and timer logic

## 🤝 Just for Fun

This project is something I’m building and refining to share with someone special, and to deepen my understanding of front-end development — one noodle at a time 🍥
